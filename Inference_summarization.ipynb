Kit Siang is the rare statesman not fixated with the past but focused on the future to chart a new course of history.We must also not forget the role played by Allahyarham Tok Guru Nik Aziz Nik Mat who consistently protected Pakatan against conservative forces within his own party and those racists and extremists outside. Sadly his death has allowed the racists and extremists to gain ascendancy. Building on Tok Guru’s legacy, Sdr. Mohamad Sabu and others made a major sacrifice to leave PAS and form Parti Amanah Negara, under severe duress and incessant attacks. We would also like to acknowledge the leadership of Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail for helping to hold the coalition together for 9th May 2018 to happen. Also, the contributions of NGOs and BERSIH in establishing a participatory platform for many Malaysians to gain political consciousness about the need for reforms.

On 9th May 2018, against all odds, millions of Malaysians stood up against the kleptocratic Najib Razak regime and miraculously voted for change. We have three political giants in Malaysian politics to thank for making change possible. Since his sacking as Deputy Prime Minister in 1998, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has been the glue to hold the then opposition parties together through Barisan Alternatif, Pakatan Rakyat and Pakatan Harapan. The past twenty years have been a long journey. The base vote and ground prepared by the original parties of Pakatan Harapan – Parti Keadilan Rakyat, Parti Amanah Negara and DAP were crucial. However, the original Pakatan Harapan parties would not have won without the leadership of Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad and the realignment with Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia. For that we thank Tun Dr. Mahathir for his courage and judgment to strike out a new political path, unimagined previously when the BN kleptocracy was seen as invincible.\" \n",

    "#text_to_summarize = \"summarize: Photosynthesis involves a series of complex reactions that take place within specialized organelles called chloroplasts in plant cells. It can be broadly divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle.  Light-Dependent Reactions: During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll pigments within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts absorb light energy. This energy is utilized to split water molecules into oxygen, protons (H+), and electrons. Oxygen is released as a byproduct, while protons and electrons are transported through an electron transport chain, generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).  Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle):  The ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are utilized in the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma of the chloroplasts. In this cycle, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combines with the stored energy in the form of ATP and NADPH to produce glucose. This glucose serves as a building block for other carbohydrates and organic compounds. Photosynthesis is a complex process that enables plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy, facilitating the sustenance of life on Earth. It involves the interplay of light-dependent reactions, which generate ATP and NADPH, and the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle, which utilize the produced energy to fix carbon dioxide and produce glucose. Enhancing our understanding of photosynthesis and its underlying mechanisms holds the key to various applications, including improving crop yields, developing sustainable bioenergy sources, and addressing environmental challenges.\"\n",
    "#text_to_summarize = \"summarize: Introduction: The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II (SALT II) treaty, signed on June 18, 1979, between the United States and the Soviet Union, marked a significant milestone in nuclear arms control efforts during the Cold War era. Building upon its predecessor, SALT I, the treaty aimed to curb the arms race and reduce the risk of nuclear conflict between the superpowers. Key Provisions: SALT II encompassed several crucial provisions. It placed limits on strategic offensive arms, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers. The agreement specified the maximum number of deployed warheads and launchers each party could possess. Verification and Compliance: To ensure compliance, the treaty established comprehensive verification measures. This involved regular exchanges of data, on-site inspections, and monitoring activities by both nations. These measures sought to enhance transparency, foster trust, and prevent either side from gaining a significant advantage in terms of strategic nuclear capabilities. Ratification and Challenges: Although both the United States and the Soviet Union signed the treaty, its ratification faced considerable challenges. The political landscape changed when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, leading to a deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations. As a result, the United States never ratified the treaty formally, rendering it non-binding. However, both nations pledged to adhere to its principles, effectively implementing its provisions on a voluntary basis. Legacy and Impact: Despite the treaty's non-ratification, SALT II's legacy and impact were significant. It set the stage for subsequent arms control negotiations, providing a framework for future agreements such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). SALT II demonstrated the potential for cooperation between the superpowers and laid the groundwork for continued dialogue aimed at reducing the nuclear threat globally.\"\n",
